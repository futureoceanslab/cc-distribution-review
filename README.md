Climate change distributional impacts in marine commercial species Review Database Repository.

This repository contains:
 
<strong>-ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS</strong>

<strong>Biomass vs distribution:</strong>
r code for the exploration of center of biomass vs center of gravity observations. Is it possible to combine them? It contains:

1. Center of biomass combined with center of gravity (We concluded this is the best option)

2. Just center of gravity observations 

3. Just center of biomass observations

<strong>Distributional impacts:</strong> 
r code for the analysis of climate variables related to the distributional impacts and their magnitude. It contains:

1. Analysis of the climate change variables that cause each of the distributional impacts (Stalked chart Figure 2D in our poster) To produce this figure the CVS "Stalked_Bar_Chart_cc_variables" is needed 

2. Magnitude of the latitude shift: boxplot, geom_bar, and histograms of different types (type 3.2 in the script Figure 2A in our poster)

3. Magnitude of the depth shift: boxplot, geom_bar, and histograms of different types (type 3 in the script Figure 2B in our poster)

4. Magnitude of the boundary shift: boxplot, geom_bar and histograms of different types (type 3 in the script Figure 2C in our poster)

5. Magnitude of the area shift: boxplot, geom_bar and histograms of different types

6. Histograms Multiplot for latitude, depth, boundary and area magnitude shifts


<strong>Pie graph: NOT UPLOADED SCRIPT!</strong>

r code for pie graphs and other graphs that donÂ´t seem useful for now






<strong>-R FOR FISH BASE REVIEW</strong>

Analysis done after the integration of our database with Fish Base data

<strong>Species code:</strong>
r code for the price category, vulnerability and commercial importance at species level. It contains:

1. Exploratory analysis of price category per distributional impact

2. Exploratory analysis of vulnerability per distributional impact

3. Exploratory analysis of commercial importance per distributional impact

4. Pie charts and ggplots on aquaculture, habitat, gears, anad/catad, years of study and commercial importance.

5. Analysis for ICES poster:

     5.1. Number of Pelagic vs. demersal (Figure 2E in our poster). To produce this figure is needed the CVS "Stalked_Bar_Chart_demers_pelag1"

     5.2. Number of commercial important species. To produce this figure is needed the CVS "Stalked_Bar_Chart_impor"

     5.3. Number of different price category species (Figure 2F in our poster). To produce this figure is needed the CVS "Stalked_Bar_Chart_price"

6. Exploratory analysis on "Do species that have a greater range shift more or less?" and "Do species that live longer shift more?"
