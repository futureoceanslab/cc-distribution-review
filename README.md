Climate change distributional impacts in marine commercial species Review Database Repository.

This repository contains:

- ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

BIOMASS VS DISTRIBUTION: 
r code for the exploration of center of biomass vs center of gravity observations. Is it possible to combine them? It contains:
Analysis 1. Center of biomass combined with center of gravity (We concluded this is the best option)
Analysis 2. Just center of gravity observations 
Analysis 3. Just center of biomass observations

DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACTS: 
r code for the analysis of climate variables related to the distributional impacts and their magnitude. It contains:
1. Analysis of the climate change variables that cause each of the distributional impacts (Stalked chart Figure 2D in our poster) To produce this figure the CVS "Stalked_Bar_Chart_cc_variables" is needed 
2. Magnitude of the latitude shift: boxplot, geom_bar, and histograms of different types (type 3.2 in the script Figure 2A in our poster)
3. Magnitude of the depth shift: boxplot, geom_bar, and histograms of different types (type 3 in the script Figure 2B in our poster)
4. Magnitude of the boundary shift: boxplot, geom_bar and histograms of different types (type 3 in the script Figure 2C in our poster)
5. Magnitude of the area shift: boxplot, geom_bar and histograms of different types
6. Histograms Multiplot for latitude, depth, boundary and area magnitude shifts

PIE GRAPH: NOT UPLOADED SCRIPT 
r code for pie graphs and other graphs that donÂ´t seem useful for now
